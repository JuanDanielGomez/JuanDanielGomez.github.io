									<h2>Detection and Tracking of Persons with 3D LiDar sensor<br /> </h2>
									<p> Using techniques normally used in classic computer vision such as background subtraction and tracking, combined with techniques for point cloud data processing such as voxelization and segmentation, this project aims to solve the problematic of detection and tracking of people in 3D point cloud data. The merit of the work relies in achieving a real-time implementation, which is normally difficult for the high amount of data in 3D point clouds. The project works as a modular framework with simple implementations of each part that work in a cohesive way to enhance the performance of the others. The modular nature also allows for future imporvements in each module to further enhance the results, the different modules of the project are Voxelization, Segmentation, Movement Detection, Classification and Tracking. </p>
									<p>Project implemented in ROS with C++ and the PCL library.</p>

									<p>Computer Vision project developped in Python, the goal was to have an unbeatable goalkeeper by detecting, tracking and predicting the trajectory of the ball and then getting to it in time to make a perfect safe! Sadly due to real-world situations (pandemic) we had to finish the project as a simulation. For more information check the full paper with all the technical details!</p>

										<p>This project is developped in HTML, CSS and JS for the web page and Java for the mobile application. It shows a vehicle position and other pertinent data in real time as well as previous data stored in a data base. The data is taken with the help of an OBD device and send to a remote socket via the mobile app. It displays the data in a graphic way, using a map to show the vehicle current position.</p>
